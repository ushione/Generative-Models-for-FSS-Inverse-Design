## Get Started
Clone the project and install requirments.
> Actually if you just want to run **python** code, the basic **pytorch** package will suffice. Most packages should be version compatible. If you encounter problems, please refer to the version used by the author. 

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ushione/Generative-Models-for-FSS-Inverse-Design.git
    cd Generative-Models-for-FSS-Inverse-Design
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
